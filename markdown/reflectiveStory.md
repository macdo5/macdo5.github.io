# Reflective Story
A lot of the work I did in the first few weeks of the second semester was the same as the work I had done in the first. It might seem stupid to do the same things twice but it gave me the opportunity to reinforce what I learnt and gave me a lot more confidence in my abilities.  
I know that the project experience here in Otago Polytech is a lot different to the intensity of the workplace, with looming deadlines and crushing responsibility, but the way we handled our project development has really resulted in something impressive for just a bunch of students.  
  
One of my favourite things I've learnt this semester is that people (or most of them) really like JSON or JSON-ish data. It's really easy to parse, even between languages. It's great for storing timestamps, geolocations, collections, and it's human readable. I'm really glad I've got nothing to do with XML, I've tried parsing it in Java and it gave me a headache.  
  
I've also learnt how to use MongoDB on my own this semester. NoSQL and Mongo in particular are not well reputed (at least from some people I've talked to). Even if Mongo turns out to be a complete flop at least I've learnt a bit more about how to learn about something. There should be an entire field of IT for self-applied research. They don't teach you how to learn things on your own, and by learning how to use MongoDB on my own I've learnt a bit more about how to teach myself new skills. If I want to get a job and keep it (or at least still qualify for new jobs), I'll have to continue expanding my IT skills but also how to teach myself.  
  
I also had to learn how to install CA certificates by myself, which is as simple as following the instructions on the CA certifiers website. It's a great feeling to see your server deployed on an official website using https, it makes it feel authentic.
Otago Polytechnic does include a bit of self-motivated teaching, one of the practicals involves learning how to use a new language and another is about a new tool for programming (APIs or something similar). But two practicals don't really cover everything, you need to practice a lot more than that!  
  
Part of the self-education includes deciding for yourself which equivalent tool are you going to use for the next project. In my case it was the decision between SQL and NoSQL. NoSQL won for two reasons: 
1. It's a new field that I would have to teach myself, improving my skills.
2. It stores objects using JSON-ish syntax, which works well with the JSON that the gateway sends to the server.  
Learning about new Python tools like [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1 "About MQTT Python client library") and creating graphs using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) was really fun and informative, definitely skills I will be able to use in the future.
  
Perhaps I wouldn't have had the bloated database problem if I had used SQL, but even so I managed to create a solution that removed the bloating. In the end I think SQL and NoSQL have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on what their use is.  
It's also been really fun to create my own web portfolio. It will be useful while looking for employment, and I will be able to continue developing code and displaying it on my portfolio.
